        <p>The industry occupies 17732m2 divided in two product units, a warehouse (frozen) and a truck <br>
             maneuvering yard.

            4 production lines for French bread and its variations, 1 line for special products (croissant, stuffed <br>
            baguettes, sweet bread) and 1 line for garlic bread. <br>       
            The second unit is a separate structure from the first and occupies 3,545 m2, distributed in <br>
